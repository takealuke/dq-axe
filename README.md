# Accessibility Testing Challenge

This is a very minimal Javascript application that uses jest to run a couple tests that use Selenium 
Webdriver and Deque's open source axe-webdriverjs integration to check a sample website

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Make sure you have ChromeDriver installed and available in your system PATH.
3. Ensure you have Google Chrome installed.
4. Run the command `jest` in the program directory

The test output, including the results from the accessibility scan will be output in the terminal
